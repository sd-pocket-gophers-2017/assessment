## Summary
In this challenge you'll design a database schema to support an application for tracking songs and playlists.  The specific requirements are presented in the releases.

### Submitting Your Solution
For this part of the assessment, you'll need to create and submit an image file of the designed database schema.  Design the schema with [Schema Designer](http://schemadesigner.devbootcamp.com) and submit a screenshot of the final design.


## Releases
### Release 0: Design the Schema
Below is a list of questions about songs, playlists, etc. and how they relate to each other in this application.  Each of the questions should be answerable based on your schema design.  When you are satisfied with your schema, take a screenshot and add it to the repository.
