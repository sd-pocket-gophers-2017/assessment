# Phase One Assessment
## Instructions

This assessment is a way to gain insight into your current abilities with the concepts taught during Phase One. This assessment will provide insight into both your strengths and areas where you might need improvement. *Success* on this assessment means that you *gain self awareness* and *expose your ignorance* to instructors who want to help you get better. These are uncomfortable, but essential to learning.

There are five parts to this assessment. Completing all five parts should take a total of about two hours. You are given 3.5 hours to complete the assessment, so there is no need to rush.

Please attempt each part of the assessment. This means you might need to leave a part unfinished and move on. We'll get better insight into where you are in relation to the entire Phase 1 curriculum if you've done some work on each part rather than you getting stuck on one part and not attempting other parts.

During the assessment you will most likely be asked to do something you don't remember exactly how to do.  You are free to use online resources, notes, and even ask instructors for help. The only thing you cannot use is a fellow student.

Do not build more complexity than is explicitly required. We are not impressed by crystal palaces of magnificent syntax. We are impressed by readable solutions that meet requirements and a good verbal explanation of what you did.
